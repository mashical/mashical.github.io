One of the limitations I commonly faced in a traditional private practice set-up was the ability to progress rehabilitation in the final stages.  I would often treat people with ACL reconstruction, total knee replacement, etc and could only progress them so far until they required something more intensive or high functioning.  Because I have full access to gym equipment as part of my service, if I ever need to educate anyone on an exercise I can demonstrate or coach them through the exercise rather than roughly explain.  
This means I am set up to walk people through a complete rehabilitation with their injuries from start to finish.
